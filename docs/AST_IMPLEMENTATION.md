## Introduction
The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code. Each node in the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The AST is a critical component for tasks such as parsing, code analysis, transformation, and code generation.

In the Zero Inbox project, the AST serves as the backbone for understanding and manipulating user-defined scripts or configuration files, enabling advanced features like static analysis, refactoring, and code generation.

## Design Goals
- **Clarity:** The AST should provide a clear and unambiguous representation of the source code.
- **Extensibility:** It should be easy to add new node types or modify existing ones as the language evolves.
- **Efficiency:** The AST should support efficient traversal and manipulation for analysis and transformation tasks.
- **Interoperability:** The AST should be compatible with other tools and libraries used in the project.

## AST Structure
The AST is organized as a hierarchical tree, where:
- The **root node** represents the entire program or script.
- **Child nodes** represent statements, expressions, or other constructs.
- **Leaf nodes** typically represent identifiers, literals, or other atomic elements.

Example structure for a simple assignment statement:

```
Assignment
├── Identifier (x)
└── Literal (42)
```

This tree represents the statement `x = 42`.

## Node Types
Common node types in the AST include:

- **Program:** The root node containing all top-level statements.
- **Statement:** Represents actions or declarations (e.g., assignment, if, while).
- **Expression:** Represents values or computations (e.g., arithmetic, function calls).
- **Identifier:** Names of variables, functions, etc.
- **Literal:** Constant values (numbers, strings, booleans).
- **Operator:** Arithmetic or logical operators.

Example node definition (in Rust):
```rust
enum ASTNode {
    Program(Vec<ASTNode>),
    Assignment { identifier: String, value: Box<ASTNode> },
    Identifier(String),
    Literal(i32),
    // ... other node types
}
```

## Parsing Process
The parsing process involves converting source code into an AST. This typically includes:
1. **Lexical Analysis:** Breaking the input into tokens (identifiers, keywords, symbols).
2. **Syntactic Analysis:** Parsing the tokens according to grammar rules to build the AST.

In Zero Inbox, the parser reads user scripts and constructs the AST using recursive descent or a parser generator, depending on the complexity of the language.

Example (pseudo-code):
```
parse_assignment():
    identifier = parse_identifier()
    expect('=')
    value = parse_expression()
    return Assignment(identifier, value)
```

## Code Examples
### Example 1: Constructing an AST for `x = 42`
```rust
let ast = ASTNode::Assignment {
    identifier: "x".to_string(),
    value: Box::new(ASTNode::Literal(42)),
};
```

### Example 2: Traversing the AST
```rust
fn traverse(node: &ASTNode) {
    match node {
        ASTNode::Assignment { identifier, value } => {
            println!("Assign to {}", identifier);
            traverse(value);
        },
        ASTNode::Literal(val) => println!("Literal: {}", val),
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

## Extending the AST
To add a new node type:
1. Define the new node in the ASTNode enum or class.
2. Update the parser to recognize and construct the new node.
3. Update any visitors or traversals to handle the new node type.

Example: Adding a `BinaryOp` node for arithmetic expressions.
```rust
enum ASTNode {
    // ... existing nodes
    BinaryOp { left: Box<ASTNode>, op: String, right: Box<ASTNode> },
}
```
