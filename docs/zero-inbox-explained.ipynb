    "\n",
    "Zero Inbox is a Rust-powered CLI tool that lets you write your day as code, then compiles it into an optimized, executable schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write**: Use a readable DSL to describe your day in `.zbx` files.\n",
    "- **Compile**: Run `zibox` to generate Markdown, shell scripts, JSON, or calendar files.\n",
    "- **Automate**: Get a plan you can check off, run, or import into your calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why is this Dev-Core?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real compiler pipeline: lexer, parser, IR, optimizer, codegen.\n",
    "- Minimalist, hackable DSL.\n",
    "- Output is code, not just a list.\n",
    "- Designed for remixing, scripting, and automation.\n",
    "- Fun, irreplacable, and open source.\n",
